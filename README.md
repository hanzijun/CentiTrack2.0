CentiTrack2.0, which is also named CentiTrack-3D, contains three key modules: the super-resolution AoA-ToF module, the relative motion trace module and the 3D tracking module, which have been fully implemented.

The experiment data is also uploaded, including "line", "curve" and "letter", in which "log.dat" and "logg.dat" are the CSI data collected on Rx1 and Rx2 respectively, the "csi_ts.txt" is the CSI timestamp used to synchronize with Leap Motion, the "data.json" is the ground truth collected by Leap Motion.
